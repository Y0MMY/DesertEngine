    // WHETHER A WRITE MAY RESIZE THE BUFFER IT IS WRITING INTO — a decision, extracted so it can be
    // asserted without a device, and so that it is taken in ONE place instead of at each write.
    //
    // The defect this exists to make unwritable: `VulkanStorageBuffer::SetData` grew by calling
    // `RT_Invalidate()`, which destroys every VkBuffer the object owns and allocates fresh ones. For a
    // buffer created with `persistent = true` that is the GPU simulation state gone — the state whose own
    // comment two files away says it "must survive across frames, and a second view must not get a fresh
    // copy of a simulation that has been running". It happened silently, from the per-frame write path,
    // and the caller was told nothing because `SetData` returned `void`.
    //
    // GROWING AND WRITING ARE DIFFERENT OPERATIONS AND THE OLD CODE SPELLED THEM THE SAME. Growing a
    // per-frame buffer is free of consequence: the GPU re-reads the whole thing next frame anyway, and
    // the reflection path deliberately allocates a placeholder 36 bytes that the first real write is
    // expected to replace (ShaderResourcesManager). Growing a buffer that carries state ACROSS frames
    // cannot be done at all — there is nothing to copy the old contents from that would still be
    // correct, because the GPU, not the CPU, is the author of those bytes. So the honest answer for that
    // case is a REFUSAL WITH A NAME, which is only expressible now that SetData answers.
    //
    // WHY THE LIFETIME IS AN ENUM AND NOT THE `bool persistent` IT REPLACES AT THIS SEAM. `false` at a
    // call site says nothing; `Persistence::PerFrame` says which of the two things is being claimed. The
    // buffer's own constructor keeps the bool it has always had — this type is about the DECISION, and a
    // decision taken from an unlabelled boolean is how the wrong branch gets chosen and read as correct.
