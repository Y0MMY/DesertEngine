     * WHAT A VOLUME GRAPH OWNS OF ITS OWN: its slice of the reserved binding window, the GLSL names it
     * declares there, and the key its authored values are filed under in a `.demat`.
     *
     * IT IS ONE HEADER BECAUSE ALL THREE ARE HALVES OF PAIRS. The emitter writes
     * `layout( std430, binding = N ) ... CloudMediumParams u_CloudMedium;` into a Medium block; the
     * renderer calls `SetStorageBuffer( N, ... )` and never consults reflection; the material editor
     * writes a value under a key and the renderer reads it back. Each of those is two files that must
     * spell the same thing, which is the defect shape this project has paid for repeatedly — so the
     * thing is spelled once, here, and both sides include it.
     *
     * THE WINDOW IS SHARED WITH THE SURFACE DOMAIN AND NOT SPLIT FROM IT. A Volume graph becomes a
     * medium compiled into four compute programs; a Surface graph becomes a program of its own. The two
     * are never the same module, so both may start at Core::kGraphOwnedBindingFirst — what the
     * reservation guarantees is that no ENGINE declaration is there, which is measured over every
     * shipped pass by Desert/Tests/Engine/ShaderCacheKey.
