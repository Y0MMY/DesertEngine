     * @brief Resolves `#include` for shaderc, from disk in a dev build and from the mounted `.dpak` in a
     *        packaged game (the read goes through the VFS-aware FileSystem).
     *
     * ONE INSTANCE PER COMPILE, which is what makes the state below per-compile rather than global: the
     * compiler constructs an includer, hands it to shaderc, and drops it when the module is built.
     *
     * WHO OWNS THE STRINGS shaderc IS GIVEN, and why it is worth a paragraph. `shaderc_include_result`
     * carries RAW POINTERS plus lengths, and shaderc reads them long after GetInclude has returned — so
     * something has to keep the bytes alive until ReleaseInclude, and the only place to put it is the
     * result's own `user_data`. Until 2026-09-08 this file took `c_str()` from two heap strings and THEN
     * moved those strings into the pair it stored in `user_data`, which is correct only while the move
     * leaves the source's buffer where it was:
     *
     *   * a LONG string is heap-allocated, the move steals the pointer, and the captured `c_str()` happens
     *     to remain valid — every shipped shader path and every shader body is long, which is why nothing
     *     was ever seen;
     *   * a SHORT string lives inside the object (small-string optimisation), the move COPIES it and
     *     clears the source, and the captured pointer then reads an EMPTY buffer while `content_length`
     *     still says the original size. The compile succeeds with the include silently blank.
     *
     * Correctness rested on the LENGTH of the data rather than on ownership, and both heap strings leaked
     * on every include besides. Ownership is expressed by the type now: the bytes are placed in their
     * final home FIRST and the pointers are taken from there, and the one owner is released in
     * ReleaseInclude. Desert/Tests/Engine/ShaderIncluderOwnership drives an include whose content is a few
     * bytes — the case the old arrangement got wrong — and the live count below back to zero.
