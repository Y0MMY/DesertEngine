// A descriptor set layout that OWNS its handle and is handed out by shared reference.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A VkDescriptorSetLayout is not just an argument to vkCreatePipelineLayout and
// vkAllocateDescriptorSets — it is the contract those two agree on. The engine used to keep the
// layouts as bare handles inside VulkanShader and destroy them in place on every recompile, while a
// pipeline layout built from them, the material's descriptor sets and a compute pipeline's in-frame
// ring each captured that handle at a DIFFERENT moment. A hot reload between any two of those moments
// left the pipeline bound to one contract and the descriptor set allocated from another, which the
// validation layer reports as
//
//     VkDescriptorSetLayout from VkPipelineLayout has 8 total descriptors,
//     but VkDescriptorSetLayout, trying to bind, has 9 total descriptors
//
// — observed for real when a shader gained a binding while the editor was running, followed by
// "dstSet has been destroyed" and a pipeline referencing a layout that no longer existed.
//
// The fix is ownership, not call order: a layout is immutable once built, every consumer keeps a
// strong reference to the exact layout it used, and a recompile REPLACES the shader's references
// instead of destroying handles other objects are still standing on. A pipeline built yesterday keeps
// working against yesterday's contract until it is rebuilt, which is the honest behaviour — the
// alternative is a pipeline whose layout has been pulled out from under it.
