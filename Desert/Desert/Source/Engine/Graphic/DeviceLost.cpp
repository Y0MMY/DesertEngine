// WHY THE ENGINE DOES NOT RECOVER FROM A LOST DEVICE, WITH THE NUMBERS BEHIND IT.
//
// Three answers were on the table. (c) — today's behaviour, die inside VK_CHECK_RESULT having explained
// nothing and saved nothing — is not one of them; it is the defect. That leaves rebuilding the device, or
// closing cleanly.
//
// REBUILDING was costed before it was refused, over this tree on 2026-09-07:
//   * 200 Vulkan/VMA call sites across 21 of our files. Every one of them reaches a VkDevice, a VkQueue or
//     a VmaAllocator that was captured at startup; after a rebuild each of those handles is a dangling
//     value that still looks valid.
//   * 43 creation sites (vkCreate*/vkAllocate*/vmaCreate*) across 16 files, and 50 Vk* member handles in
//     16 classes. Each needs an invalidate-and-rebuild entry point; 11 resource classes have one today,
//     the rest do not.
//   * NOTHING CAN ENUMERATE THE LIVE RESOURCES. There is one global registry; everything else — a panel's
//     offscreen SceneRenderer, a thumbnail's framebuffer, a material's descriptor sets, the ImTextureID
//     every open panel is holding — is owned by whoever made it. Recovery would first have to build an
//     ownership census that does not exist, and a census that misses one owner produces a stale handle
//     that renders garbage instead of failing.
// That is a subsystem, not a task, and it is filed as one.
//
// CLOSING CLEANLY is what this file implements, and on this platform it is also the better answer rather
// than merely the cheaper one. An `kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorInnocentVictim` means the machine's
// whole GPU stack has just been through recovery. The user's data is on the CPU side and completely
// intact at that instant; the single most valuable thing the process can do is get it to disk and stop,
// which is exactly what a marked-unclean exit plus the existing autosave does.
//
// WHAT WOULD CHANGE THE ANSWER: a resource ownership registry that can enumerate every live GPU object
// (wanted for other reasons too — teardown order, hot reload, and the "which slot is this?" question the
// renderer-slot work keeps asking). Once that exists, rebuilding becomes a walk over a list instead of an
// archaeology exercise, and this refusal should be revisited.
//
// THAT CONDITION HAS NOW BEEN TESTED, AND THE REFUSAL STANDS — 2026-09-08, owner's decision, taken on the
// number rather than on an estimate.
//
// The asset-eviction work (A7) built exactly the kind of accounting this comment was waiting for, and its
// own obligation was to say, in a number, how much of the GPU it can actually see. The answer:
//
//     live GPU objects, tree-wide ........... 683
//     unreachable for the asset registry .... 330   (48 %)
//
// So the registry the condition above asked for arrived and covers barely half the problem. The other 330
// are precisely the objects listed further up — preview render targets, thumbnails, descriptor sets,
// pipelines, frame buffers — the ones with no asset behind them to be registered against. Recovery would
// still have to build a second ownership registry for that half, from scratch, with the same failure mode
// as before: a census that misses one owner yields a stale handle that renders garbage instead of failing.
//
// The measurement is the deliverable here. A7 made this task cheaper, not free, and "cheaper" turned out
// not to be enough — which is a result, not a stall. Clean closure plus the emergency save stays the
// shipped behaviour.
//
// WHAT WOULD CHANGE THE ANSWER NOW is narrower and therefore more useful than what it replaced: not "an
// ownership registry" in general, but a registry that owns the 330 — the objects created by panels,
// thumbnails and the renderer's own per-frame state. If any other task ever needs to enumerate those (a
// live memory budget per panel, or preview teardown that is not a leak, would both need it), then the cost
// of this one collapses and it should be re-costed on the spot. Until then, do not re-derive this: the
// number above is the argument.
