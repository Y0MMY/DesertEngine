     * WHAT A CLOUD QUALITY TIER IS ALLOWED TO CHANGE, as three numbers and not as six.
     *
     * THE SHORT VERSION, because the long one below is a list of refusals: this subsystem has exactly
     * three costs a cheaper setting can buy back without breaking something that is asserted elsewhere —
     * the shadow ray a lit sample traces toward the sun, the map the layer casts onto the world, and the
     * transmittance at which the view march gives up. Everything else that looks like a quality knob is
     * pinned, and the pinning is a relation with a test behind it rather than an opinion.
     *
     * WHAT IS PINNED, AND BY WHAT. Measured on the shipped library; the numbers are in
     * Docs/Clouds/CALIBRATION.md section QT.
     *
     *   * MAX STEPS cannot fall. The march's SEARCH step is CLOUD_COARSE_STEP_MULTIPLIER x
     *     CLOUD_DISTANCE_TO_MAX_STEPS_KM / MaxSteps, so the finest chord it can be relied on to FIND is
     *     32 km / MaxSteps — 125 m at the component's 256. The two tightest shipped types (Altocumulus
     *     and Cirrus) place a median chord of 137 m, which is 1.10x that and no more. MaxSteps 234 is
     *     where the margin is gone; at 192 four of the nine shipped types are past Nyquist and at 128
     *     five of them are, the worst at 0.55x. A tier that lowers this number does not make the sky
     *     cheaper and softer, it makes four kinds of cloud dither in and out with the ray's jitter, and
     *     Desert/Tests/Engine/CloudType asserts exactly that and now asserts it FOR EVERY TIER.
     *
     *   * THE SHADOW MAP'S TEXEL cannot grow, because it is the same relation seen from the other side:
     *     Desert/Tests/Engine/CloudShadow requires the texel to sit inside the chord the march can find.
     *     At 512 texels over a 30 km radius the texel is 117 m against that 125 m. Dropping the
     *     resolution to 256 alone takes the texel to 234 m — 1.9x past the chord — and the only way to
     *     make 234 m legal is to raise the chord by lowering MaxSteps, which the paragraph above forbids.
     *     So the map's cost is bought back by shrinking WHAT IT COVERS instead of how finely it covers
     *     it: resolution, extent and snap are scaled by ONE number together, which leaves the texel
     *     exactly where it was and moves only the radius around the camera that receives cloud shadow at
     *     all. That is a limit the map already has and states (CLOUD_SHADOWMAP_EXTENT_KM); the tier moves
     *     it, it does not invent it.
     *
     *   * THE SHADOW MAP'S SAMPLE COUNT cannot fall either, and for the third face of the same relation:
     *     the count has to resolve the shipped congestus envelope, 3.6 km / 32 = 112 m against the same
     *     125 m chord. Sixteen — the count the shadow-map task priced at 2.75 ms — is 225 m, 1.8x past
     *     it, and its own measurement said so beside the price.
     *
     * WHAT IS NOT PINNED, AND IS THEREFORE THE WHOLE TIER:
     *
     *   * THE SHADOW RAY'S SAMPLE COUNT. Linear, 0.233 ms of frame time per sample on this machine, no
     *     relation attached to it at all, and the quality it buys is known to the per cent
     *     (VolumetricCloudData::LightMarchSamples carries the convergence table). It is the first thing a
     *     tier should reach for and it is the only per-sample knob that is free to move.
     *
     *   * THE SHADOW MAP'S FOOTPRINT, as described above.
     *
     *   * WHERE THE MARCH GIVES UP. Stop Transmittance 0.005 -> 0.05 is 2.83 ms — sixteen per cent — for
     *     a frame that differs from the default by at most 10 of 255 anywhere, which is the best cost per
     *     visible unit in the whole subsystem. The samples it drops are behind material that has already
     *     hidden them. Its ONE caveat is stated rather than smoothed over: unlike the two above, this
     *     saving is scene-dependent — a sky of thin cloud never reaches either threshold, so it costs
     *     nothing and saves nothing there.
     *
     * WHAT WAS MEASURED AND LEFT OUT. Multiple-scattering octaves: the octave loop re-uses ONE shadow
     * march (Programs/Clouds/CloudRaymarch.shader, the comment above the loop), so three octaves cost
     * 0.32 ms more than one — under two per cent, and inside the run-to-run spread of that row — while
     * turning the clouds grey. A knob that changes the picture and not the cost is the wrong half of a
     * tier. The shadow ray's DISTANCE: shortening it moves no cost at all, because the count is what is
     * marched and the distance only decides how far apart the samples are — it is a way to make the
     * clouds flat for free rather than fast.

         * 2 x extent / resolution, so scaling both by the same factor leaves it — and therefore the
         * relation against the march's resolvable chord, which is the thing that must not move — exactly
         * where the shipped tier put it. The snap travels with them because the coverage guaranteed
         * around the camera is extent - snap/2, and a snap that did not scale would eat the smaller
         * extent from the inside. Three numbers scaled independently is three ways to break one relation;
