        /**
         * @brief Blocking parallel loop over [0, count) handed out in CONTIGUOUS RANGES of at most
         *        @p grain indices: body(begin, end) is called once per range and must process every index
         *        in [begin, end).
         *
         * WHY RANGES AND NOT INDICES. A body with per-range setup — a scratch buffer, a bin lookup, a
         * thread-local accumulator — cannot express itself through body(index) without either
         * reallocating per element or reaching for thread_local, and thread_local in a shared pool is
         * state that outlives the loop that filled it. ParallelFor below is this function with the range
         * walked for you, so there is ONE mechanism and not two.
         *
         * RANGES ARE CLAIMED, NOT DEALT. Every participant pulls the next unclaimed range off one cursor,
         * so a range that costs ten times its neighbours is absorbed by whoever finishes first instead of
         * holding the whole loop up. Pick @p grain so that one range is worth claiming (a lock and a
         * couple of hundred nanoseconds) and small enough that there are several per participant.
         *
         * SAFE TO CALL FROM A WORKER, INCLUDING FROM INSIDE ANOTHER PARALLEL LOOP, and that is the whole
         * reason this shape exists. The previous implementation dealt one chunk per participant up front
         * and then waited for EVERY chunk it had submitted. A chunk still sitting in the queue can only
         * ever run on a worker, so if every worker is itself blocked in such a wait, no chunk runs, no
         * worker is freed, and the pool hangs — a cycle, not a slowdown. The engine walked straight into
         * it: the cloud modelling bake runs ON a worker (VolumetricCloudRenderer), and parallelising its
         * z-slices with the old ParallelFor would have been exactly that nested call.
         *
         * WHY THE CYCLE CANNOT FORM NOW. This function never waits on a job that has not started:
         *   - all the work is claimed from one cursor, so a helper job that is never scheduled owes
         *     nothing and is not waited for;
         *   - the caller claims and runs ranges itself until the cursor is empty, so the loop always
         *     completes even if not one helper ever runs;
         *   - only then does it wait, and only on the ranges a helper has ALREADY CLAIMED — and a helper
         *     that has claimed one is by definition running on a worker thread.
         * The wait's precondition is therefore "a thread that is running will finish", never "a job needs
         * a free worker". Worst case — every worker busy — the caller does all the work serially, which
         * is precisely what the old implementation degraded to when it did not hang. Nesting is covered by
         * the same argument by induction: a body that calls this function again does not block on the pool
         * either, so "a running range finishes" stays true at any depth.
         *
         * WHAT IS STILL YOUR RESPONSIBILITY: the body must not wait for work only a WORKER can do — an
         * Async() future, a hand-rolled latch another job signals. That is the one way to reintroduce the
         * cycle, and no primitive here can detect it.
         *
         * @param grain 0 is read as 1.
