// It used to. The include sat behind `__has_include` with a "0.0.0+unknown" fallback, and that guard
// was not free: ccache's direct mode keys an object on the headers the translation unit ACTUALLY
// included, so a header that appears later never invalidates the cached object. A tree built once
// before the generator had ever run kept reporting 0.0.0 until somebody deleted Version.o by hand —
// and that string is not cosmetic, it reaches the user through engines.json and the launcher sidebar.
//
// Generating the header is now part of the build — the Common project does it before this file can be
// compiled — so it is on disk by the time this TU is compiled, or the build has already failed. The
// guard therefore becomes a diagnostic and never a fallback: it produces no code path, it only says
// what to run. That is `premake5 gmake2` (scripts/Windows/Setup.bat on Windows), because a tree whose
// makefiles or project files predate the version hook has no hook to fire.
