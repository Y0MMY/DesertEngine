//
// Common/CloudGeometry.glslh is compiled here AS C++ (CloudGeometryReference.hpp), so every assertion
// below is about the text the march compiles. The four things this suite exists for are the four a frame
// cannot show:
//
//   * THE ROOTS ARE SIGNED. A ray aimed away from the shell must come back negative and read as a miss.
//     Take the absolute value — the obvious simplification — and every ray "hits" the layer behind the
//     camera, which renders as cloud mirrored below the horizon and looks like a coverage problem.
//   * THE CONSTANT TERM IS FACTORED. At |o| and r both near 6360, dot(o,o) - r*r discards seven of the
//     eight digits float32 has. The factored form is metres where the naive one is tens of metres, and
//     the difference is only visible as jitter on a boundary near the horizon.
//   * THE SEGMENT IS THE SHELL, in all three camera cases, with "nothing to march" encoded as y <= x.
//   * THE HEIGHT FRACTION FOLLOWS THE CURVATURE. Measured from the planet centre, a sample twenty
//     kilometres away at the same ALTITUDE sits at the same fraction as one overhead. Measured on the
//     world Y — which agrees near the camera and is therefore what a close-up frame endorses — the whole
//     layer compresses into its own floor at the horizon.
