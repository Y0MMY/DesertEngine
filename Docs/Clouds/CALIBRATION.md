# Calibrating the cloud layer against the UE reference — what was measured and what it found

The reference is `UEReference/UE_mid.png`: Unreal's shipped volumetric cloud, default material, default
component, rendered from a ground camera. The comparison is not by eye. `Tools/ImageStat` (built from the
vendored `stb_image`) reports five numbers over the sky region of a frame, and it was these that found the
defects — three attempts at tuning by eye before it existed produced nothing.

| metric | what it says |
|---|---|
| `p05` | how DARK the darkest twentieth is — the blue gaps and the shadowed undersides |
| `p50` | the overall level |
| `p95` | how bright the highlights are — sunlit cloud tops |
| `contrast` = p95 − p05 | the dynamic range the image actually occupies |
| `sat` | mean saturation — whether the sky is blue or washed |

## The progression

| frame | mean | p05 | p50 | p95 | contrast | sat |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **UE reference** | 0.602 | **0.316** | 0.648 | **0.798** | **0.482** | 0.190 |
| ours, before | 0.650 | 0.567 | 0.654 | 0.731 | 0.164 | 0.411 |
| ours, after the shadow ray | 0.728 | 0.677 | 0.729 | 0.783 | **0.106** | 0.209 |
| **ours, calibrated** | 0.565 | 0.389 | 0.585 | 0.722 | **0.333** | 0.235 |

## What the measurements found

### 1. The shadow ray was thirty times too short

`LightMarchDistance` was 500 m against Unreal's `ShadowTracingDistance` of 15 km. A shadow ray started
inside a two-kilometre cloud and only 500 m long never leaves it, so every sample in the body sees roughly
the same optical depth and the body is shaded uniformly. That is why the clouds were flat.

Fixed: 15 km, six samples. The samples are on a squared distribution, so this is not thirty times the
cost — the first few still land in the metres nearest the sample.

### 2. The clouds were DARKER than the sky they sat on

The decisive measurement was a frame with the clouds switched OFF: the clear sky alone measured mean 0.740,
p05 0.646, p95 **0.869** — brighter at every point than the sky WITH clouds (p95 0.783). A sunlit cloud
was coming out darker than the blue behind it, which is backwards and which no amount of cloud tuning
could fix.

**The cause is that this engine describes one sun with two numbers.** `SkyAtmosphereData::SunIntensity`
says how bright the sky's own sun is — 22 in these scenes. `DirectionalLightData::Intensity` says how
brightly the sun lights things — 1. `AtmosphereEnv` documents the split deliberately ("they differ by more
than an order of magnitude and that is the point, not a defect"), and the height fog already navigates it.

The clouds are lit, correctly, by what actually falls on things. So the sky was being drawn with a sun
twenty-two times brighter than the one lighting the clouds in front of it.

**This was NOT fixed in code**, and deliberately. Lighting the clouds with the sky's sun was tried and
measured: p95 0.966, everything clipped to white. The inconsistency is in the SCENE, not the renderer, and
the fix is to make one sun out of two — the demo scene now carries a directional light of 22 with an
exposure of 0.22, so the sun that lights the clouds is the sun that draws the sky.

Worth knowing for every future scene: **a scene whose sky SunIntensity and light Intensity disagree will
have clouds that cannot be brighter than the sky.** That is a scene-authoring trap the engine currently
does nothing to catch.

### 3. Coverage was near-overcast where the reference is half-clear

At the settings that filled the frame, 92% of the sky was touched by cloud. The reference is about half
open, and the deep blue between clouds is where its `p05` of 0.316 comes from. Ours could not go dark
because there was nothing dark left in the frame.

### 4. Radial moire at the horizon — the far field repeating

Raising `MaxViewDistance` to 150 km to fill the horizon band made the weather tile repeat about twenty
times toward the vanishing point, and the repetition shows as streaks radiating from it. Pulled back to
60 km with a 12 km tile; the aerial-perspective ramp keeps the band without needing the extra distance.

## Where it stands

Contrast 0.333 against the reference's 0.482, with mean, median and saturation all in the same family. The
remaining gap is in the dark end — our blue gaps are 0.389 against 0.316 — and the two frames are not the
same sun angle or the same camera elevation, so an exact match is not the target.

## The instrument

`Tools/ImageStat` — a standalone CLI over the vendored `stb_image`, linked against nothing else.

```
./build/Bin/Debug/ImageStat <png> <x0> <y0> <x1> <y1> [<png> <x0> <y0> <x1> <y1> ...]
```

Several images per invocation, because the numbers only mean something side by side: a contrast of 0.333
says nothing until the reference's 0.482 is on the line below it. Every visual claim in this programme
that turned out to be wrong was wrong in a way this would have caught in one run.
