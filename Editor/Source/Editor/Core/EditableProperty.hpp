     * @brief ONE PROPERTY OF THE FOCUSED DOCUMENT, as a value. The vocabulary of the control channel's
     *        SECOND REQUEST CATEGORY.
     *
     * WHY THERE IS A SECOND CATEGORY AT ALL, and why it is a category rather than a second execution path.
     *
     * The channel executes the COMMAND PALETTE (Editor/Core/Control/ControlDispatch.hpp): a dictionary of
     * ACTIONS, each with a name a person could say out loud. Dragging a slider is not one of those. It has
     * no name, and inventing one would mean a palette entry per value — "Set Albedo to 0.3", a hundred and
     * seventy of them for one material — which is not a dictionary of actions, it is a serialised argument
     * list wearing one.
     *
     * So a property edit is a DIFFERENT KIND OF REQUEST, and the rule it must not break is the one about
     * EXECUTION: the value has to land in the same setter the widget calls. It does — MaterialEditorPanel::
     * WriteParam is the single write, reached by the slider and by `set` alike. One path, two ways to call
     * it, which is the point of the channel rather than an exception to it. What stays forbidden is a
     * second dispatch mechanism for palette COMMANDS; nothing here is one.
     *
     * THE CENSUS IS DERIVED, NEVER WRITTEN OUT. A document builds this list from the same declaration its
     * own editor draws from — for a material, the shader's `Properties` block, through
     * MaterialEdit::DescribeProperties. A hand-written list of names would be a THIRD list of parameter
     * names beside the schema and the widget table, and a third list is the defect shape this codebase
     * spends its days removing: two of them agree, the one nobody remembers falls behind, and what the
     * channel offers stops being what the window edits.
     *
     * NO ImGui AND NO glm HERE ON PURPOSE. This type crosses ISubjectDocument, the control channel's JSON
     * writer and a test suite that links only Common; a header that dragged a UI toolkit behind it could
     * not be asserted anywhere the editor is not built.
