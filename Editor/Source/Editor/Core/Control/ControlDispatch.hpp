     * @brief ADDRESSING A COMMAND, and nothing else.
     *
     * THE CHANNEL EXECUTES THE COMMAND PALETTE, NOT A LIST OF ITS OWN. That decision is the whole shape
     * of this subsystem, so it is worth writing down where the addressing lives.
     *
     * EditorLayer already fills a dictionary every frame with that frame's candidates — the tool panels,
     * the open documents, the entities in the open scene, the actions (BuildPaletteCommands). A person
     * reaches it with Ctrl+P; the channel reaches the SAME entries by naming a group and a label, and
     * calls the SAME std::function. So everything a person can do, an agent can do, by construction —
     * and a capability added for one arrives for the other with nobody wiring it up twice.
     *
     * The alternative on offer was a command table belonging to the channel. That is a second execution
     * path, and a second path is the defect this codebase spends its days removing: two sides that must
     * agree, one of which falls behind. When the palette turns out not to cover something the channel
     * needs, the palette is what grows — which is also how a person gets the missing capability.
     *
     * NOTHING HERE KNOWS WHAT A COMMAND DOES. It takes any range of things carrying a Group and a Label,
     * which is what makes the addressing rule assertable by a suite without an editor, an ImGui context
     * or a GPU — and it has to be, because EditorLayer.cpp is compiled by no suite at all.
