    // The pending "open THIS subject in whatever edits it" requests — the wire between a panel that has a
    // subject (the browser's double-click, the Details panel's button beside a component) and EditorLayer,
    // which is the only place that may create or destroy a document window.
    //
    // WHY THIS IS NOT [[PanelRequests]]. PanelRequests carries a panel NAME and no payload, so it can say
    // "show the Material Preview" and never "show MP_GreenTint". That is exactly why the editor grew three
    // hand-wired file-static inboxes instead (NodeGraphPanel::RequestOpen, MaterialPreviewPanel::
    // RequestPreview, SceneOpenRequest) — each one a private wire for one asset kind. This is the one wire
    // that carries the subject, so the next kind adds a factory rather than a fourth inbox.
    //
    // ONE FIELD NOW, WHERE THERE WERE TWO. The request used to be `{ AssetHandle Subject; AssetTypeID Type; }`,
    // which is a subject with the domain left out because there was only one — and that missing third of the
    // identity is the whole reason a component could not be opened. SubjectId carries it (see
    // Editor/Core/EditorSubject.hpp), so the Details panel's button and the browser's double-click now send
    // the same message.
