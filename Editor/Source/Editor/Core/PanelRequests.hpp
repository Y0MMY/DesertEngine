    // Tool panels used to open themselves off the selection (IPanel::IsContextual): click an animated
    // character and the Anim Graph, the Layers panel and the Sequencer all threw themselves over the
    // editor. Selecting an object is not a request to author its animation — so those panels are opened
    // by a BUTTON now (Details ▸ Animation ▸ "Anim Graph", the toolbar's Browse, the status bar's
    // drawers), and this is the wire between the button and the panel: the requester does not need the
    // panel's type, its instance, or its header.
    //
    // Open vs Toggle: a jump INTO a tool ("open this in the Sequencer") always shows it, because the user
    // is going there. A drawer button is a switch — pressing Browse again puts the browser away, which is
    // what a button that is always on screen has to do.
    //
    // The editor's panel loop consumes each request once per frame.
