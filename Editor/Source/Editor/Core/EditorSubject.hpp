// DELIBERATELY FREE OF THE EDITOR AND THE ENGINE. This header is included by IPanel.hpp, which is included
// by EditorLayer.hpp ahead of the render-system headers; anything it drags in is dragged in there too, and
// SubjectEditorRegistry.hpp's own top note records what that cost the last time (a header opening
// `Desert::Editor::Core` silently rebound every unqualified `Core::Scene` after it). It is also what makes
// the seam testable at all: the suites that assert these rules link `Common` and nothing else.

{
    // ── WHAT A DOCUMENT EDITS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // The seam used to be keyed on an ASSET HANDLE, and every document in the editor was therefore an
    // asset. That was true of the five that existed and false of the ones the owner asked for next: an
    // anim graph, a particle emitter and a UI canvas are authored data that lives in a COMPONENT ON AN
    // ENTITY and has no file of its own. The button the owner wanted in the Details panel — "edit this
    // thing" beside the component that holds it — had nowhere to go, because the request that button
    // sends carries an `AssetHandle` and a component is not one.
    //
    // SO THE KEY IS A SUBJECT, AND A SUBJECT IS NOT A UNION OF TWO CASES. Writing it as
    // `variant<AssetHandle, pair<EntityUUID, ComponentKind>>` would have been the two cases that exist
    // today frozen into the type, and the third one is already visible: one emitter inside a system, one
    // state inside a graph — an owner plus a part of it. What a subject actually is, is three things:
    //
    //   IDENTITY   this and no other, stable across frames, comparable, printable
    //   REACH      a way to get from the identity back to the data (who knows how, and in what)
    //   LIFE       a way to know the data is still there
    //
    // This header carries the IDENTITY. REACH is the factory registered for the subject's type
    // (SubjectEditorRegistry) — it is typed, so it cannot live in a common struct. LIFE is
    // ISubjectDocument::IsSubjectAlive, asked of the document because the document is what holds the
    // scene or the asset manager the answer needs.
    //
    // Identity decomposes into three fields and not one, and none of the three is spare:
    //
    //   DOMAIN   what kind of thing OWNS the data: a file, an entity. The registry is keyed on
    //            (domain, facet), so a component type and an asset type can never collide even if their
    //            numbers agree.
    //   FACET    WHICH KIND within that domain: the AssetTypeID for a file, the component's type for an
    //            entity. This is the existing `AssetOpenRequest::Type` field generalised — the editor
    //            already had to carry it, because a handle alone never said which editor to open.
    //   OWNER    the 64-bit id of the owner: the AssetHandle, or the entity's UUID.
    //
    // WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT: an ordinal saying WHICH of several same-kind parts of one owner. The
    // two future cases above will need one, and nothing today writes one — a field no caller sets is a
    // dead parameter, and this file would be asserting an identity it cannot tell apart. When the first
    // "one emitter of several" document arrives it adds a fourth field here and the census in
    // SubjectEditorRegistry is what will show every call site that has to learn about it.
