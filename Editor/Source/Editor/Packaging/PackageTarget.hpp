    // WHICH PLATFORM CAN THIS EDITOR PACKAGE FOR, AND WHAT DOES THAT IMPLY?
    //
    // Exactly one: its own host. `PackageGame` ships the Runtime binary that was built beside this
    // editor, by this machine's toolchain — there is no cross-compiler in this repository and no
    // Runtime for another platform to copy. The Windows build is msbuild on a Windows runner
    // (.github/workflows/ci.yml), so a Windows package is produced by an editor RUNNING on Windows and
    // in no other way.
    //
    // This header exists because that fact used to be stated in three places and enforced in none. The
    // Build Settings panel drew a three-row "Target platform" chooser whose answer nothing read, so
    // selecting "Windows x64" on macOS produced a macOS package in silence (contract §1.3 and §1.4 at
    // once — П6). The packager separately hard-coded macOS in four places: the binary's name, the .app
    // layout, the bash launcher and the build script named in the "not found" error. Both halves now
    // derive from the ONE description below, which is what makes the panel's claim and the packager's
    // behaviour incapable of disagreeing.
    //
    // WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: a `TargetPlatform` field in `PackageOptions`. A chooser whose only
    // reachable value is the host is the same dead setting in a new place; the platform is DERIVED, in
    // one function, and read by both sides. The day a cross-toolchain exists is the day a second value
    // becomes possible and the field becomes worth having — and not before.
